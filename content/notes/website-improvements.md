website"

Some ideas for content that I want to put on this website:

- [x] a personal blog
- [ ] a digital cv - either just hosting a PDF or writing some custom css to format everything nicely
- [x] a reading list & place to review books I've read, basically an online library / bookshelf,
maybe a way to replace my Goodreads account
- [x] programming side projects
- [x] a custom bookmarks page for websites and links I commonly use (maybe just one big html table)

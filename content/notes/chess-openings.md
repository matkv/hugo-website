## Tactical vs. Positional openings

[Link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vScs84UlQpEP-dsde2HeSmDgDTTgK9LLQW9N1aNbE05jhjPskyEbiHSk_CTgIcbIShV7qywws8Vy_7H/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000#slide=id.ged614816f3_1_168) to the Google Presentation for an overview of chess openings that I found on Reddit.

### Tactical opening

* Usually sharp & typically open position
* Often many pawns have been traded off
* Gambit openings (willingly sacrificing material to gain lead in development)
* Tends to require more theory
* Gambits are good for players that love to sacrifice material & work well against unprepared players, especially in speed chess (blitz, bullet)

### Positional opening

* Often closed position
* Pawns blocking each other in the center
* Gradual improvement by maneuvering
* Depriving opponents pieces of active squares, preparing pawn breaks
* Play tends to be slow paced, knowledge of general strategy is more important than memorizing theory

## System based vs. Theory based openings

### System based

- The same piece setup -  regardless what the opponent plays (more or less)
    - Flexible move order
    - Less chance of committing a serious blunder in the opening
- Often leads to more passive and defensive positions
- May lead to playing "mindless" chess

### Theory based

- Usually requires players to memorize some concrete lines

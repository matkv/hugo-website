# Welcome!

I am a software developer from Austria. I work with **C#/.NET** professionally and in my free time I have been getting using **Flutter**, **Python** and I've been trying to learn more about **Golang**. Other than that my main side project at the moment is actually this website - the GitHub repo for it can be found [here](https://github.com/matkv/hugo-website).

This new website will probably be used as a digital CV, a place to show off some side projects that I have worked on and as a personal blog.

It is currently **under construction**. I am building this site using the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). The project repository has a GitHub Action that automatically builds the hugo site and deploys it to GitHub Pages.

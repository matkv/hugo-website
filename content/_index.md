# Welcome!

I am a software developer from Austria. I work with **C#/.NET** professionally and in my free time I have been getting into **Flutter**, **Python** and **Go**.

This is my new website will probably be used as a digital CV, a place to show off some projects that I have worked on and maybe as a personal blog.

It is currently under construction.

# Welcome!

I am a software developer from Austria. I work with **C#/.NET** professionally and in my free time I have been using **C#**, **Flutter/Dart** and a little bit of **Python** & **Go**. I'm currently interested in learning **Rust**!

My main side project at the moment is actually this website - the GitHub repository for it can be found [here](https://github.com/matkv/hugo-website). This new website will probably be used as a digital CV, a place to show off some side projects that I have worked on and as a personal blog.

It is currently **under construction**. I am building this site using the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). The project repository has a GitHub Action that automatically builds the hugo site and deploys it to GitHub Pages.

I'm Matko, a 27 year old software developer from Austria. I work with **C#/.NET** professionally at [Intact](https://intact-systems.com/), and for some personal projects I have been using **Flutter/Dart**, a little bit of **Python** & **Go**, and I am currently learning **Rust**!

In my free time my biggest hobbies are music - I play piano & guitar, exercising (mostly running and some strength training) and reading.

I just created a page for my **book reviews** - [here](/reading) are all the books I have read since I got a Kindle (back in 2019).

### About this website 

This website is built using the static site generator [hugo](https://gohugo.io).
The [project repository](https://github.com/matkv/hugo-website) for this site uses a GitHub action to **automatically build and deploy** the site to GitHub pages. This basically lets me use & work on this site without necessarily needing a local hugo install. 

Apart from the script for the dark mode functionality, it has been completely written by myself!

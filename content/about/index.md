I'm Matko, a 27 year old software developer from Austria. I work with **C#/.NET** professionally at [Intact](https://intact-systems.com/), and for some personal projects I have been using **Flutter/Dart**, a little bit of **Python** & **Go**, and I am currently learning **Rust**!

### Interests & hobbies

In my free time my biggest hobbies are music - I play piano & guitar, exercising (these days mostly strength training, cycling and some running), reading, playing [chess](https://lichess.org/@/matkv) and recently I've been getting into watching movies again.

I created a page for my **book reviews** - [here](/reading) are all the books I have read since I got a Kindle (back in 2019).

I'm Matko, a 27 year old software engineer from Austria. Apart from technology, my biggest interests are music (I play piano & guitar), exercising (running & strength training), reading and recently I've been getting into chess.

On this page I plan to show some basic information about me & probably a digital CV that describes my education and my past and current workplaces.

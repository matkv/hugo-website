I decided to give up on trying to get a productive NeoVim config set up anytime soon - I will instead try out **LunarVim**.

<!--more-->

This is an IDE layer for Neovim that supposedly already has most of things needed for development with Neovim/Lunarvim configured by default. I guess I'll just install that and then change the config where needed.

I won't be documenting the config process on here though, I think I'll just add it to my README.md in the [dotfiles repository.](https://github.com/matkv/dotfiles).

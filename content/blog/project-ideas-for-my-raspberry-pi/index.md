Now that my old Raspberry Pi isn't used anymore as a 24/7 torrent box for my ... Linux ISOs, here are some ideas about what I could use for now.
<!--more-->

Most likely I'll do a fresh install of Manjaro ARM again because it was actually very comfortable to use for the torrent box use case & I'm very used to Manjaro anyways because I use it as my main OS on my laptop.

* mirror of my GitHub profile / local git server
* a syncthing device with local harddrive
* Kodi / Plex client (but I wouldn't really be able to watch 4K content)

I decided to try out Neovim so I will use this blog post to document the setup process.

My main goals are:

* Automate the setup process as much as possible so that I can easily reuse my configuration on a different computer.
* Setup an built-in file browser and a nice theme (maybe the palenight theme)
* Setup code completion for my most used languages, maybe try C# first

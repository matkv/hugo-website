After struggling to find ideas for side projects & not really being motivated about any of my current pet projects I have decided to try learning **Rust**. 
<!--more-->
Initially I was torn between getting back into **Go** (which I used very briefly about 2 years ago) and **Rust** but after reading up on both languages and looking at what kind of projects each language is generally used for, I decided to give Rust a shot.

Considering that I use C# at work, I feel like learning Rust would be more benefitial to improving my skills as a programmer in general than Go. I never really used a language that is somewhat ***low level*** so this will definitely be a new experience for me. To be honest I'm pretty clueless about it right now but I'm looking forward to trying it out. Who knows if I'll actually stick with it :D

Today I will just set up the dev environment, the tooling seems to be pretty nice & there's an official VSCode extension. I'm not sure where (or if) I'll document the process and write notes in general.

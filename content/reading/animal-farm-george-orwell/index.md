I get the overall message, but I just found it way too predictable and just like with 1984 I just don't really love Orwell's writing style. All in all I think it's worth the read though, even if it's just for the references in popular culture and general idea and political allegory.

If it hadn't been such a super short read I would have probably quit reading it.

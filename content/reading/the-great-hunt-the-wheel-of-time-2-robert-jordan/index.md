Really liked this one. I did take a break of a week or two while I read some different books but overall I like that I got to know the characters even more now and the story is really starting to pick up. I especially enjoyed some of the new friendships that were formed in this one.

I don't have any big criticism when it comes to the pacing, I think it was definitely better than the first one.

Super curious about the next book because I heard that it's one of the best in the series!

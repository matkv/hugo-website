Here's what I'm currently up to.

### Programming

* Learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using the official [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings).
* Working on this website. The GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/matkv/hugo-website).

### Reading

* The Dragon Reborn (Wheel Of Time, Book 4) - Robert Jordan
* Lessons in Stoicism - John Sellars

All my finished books & reviews for them are on my [book reviews](/reading) page.

### Movies

I'm trying to not rely on streaming services so I'm currently working on building my personal offline movie collection of all the movies on my watchlist and the ones that I have already seen & rated. 

Right now I'm in the process of trying to nicely name and organize around 370 movies and a bunch of tv shows - I'm using [filebot](https://www.filebot.net/) to automate this as much as I can.

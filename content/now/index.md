Here's what I'm currently up to.

### Programming

* Started working on a small [Rust tool](https://github.com/matkv/lichess-stats) to read and display stats from [Lichess](https://lichess.org)
* Learning Rust
* Working on [this website](https://github.com/matkv/hugo-website)

### Reading

* The Shadow Rising (Wheel Of Time, Book 4) - Robert Jordan
* Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftmanship - Robert C. Martin

All my finished books & reviews for them are on my [book reviews](/reading) page.

### Obsidian

* Building a personal knowledge base using [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md) & importing all my existing notes from various places 

### Chess

* Playing bullet, blitz & rapid chess daily on Lichess
* Trying to find some openings to learn

### Doom Emacs

* Forcing myself to use Doom Emacs as my main text editor in order to get used to it
* Managed to mostly set up everything I need for C# development, Rust development and web development and I'm now finally getting more used to navigating around Doom Emacs in general

### Movies

* Organising my offline movie collection so I don't need to rely on streaming services

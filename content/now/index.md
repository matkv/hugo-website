Here's what I'm currently up to.

### Programming

* Started working on a small cli program that is supposed to return nicely formatted data
about any player on [Lichess](https://www.lichess.org). The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/matkv/lichess-stats).
* Learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using the official [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings).
* Working on this website. The GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/matkv/hugo-website).

### Obsidian

* Setting up my [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md) vault & learning how I can get most out of this tool.

### Reading

* The Shadow Rising (Wheel Of Time, Book 4) - Robert Jordan
* Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftmanship - Robert C. Martin
* The Midnight Library - Matt Haig

All my finished books & reviews for them are on my [book reviews](/reading) page.

### Chess

Currently going through a general opening course and trying to find one opening for white & one for black that I can really focus on.

### Doom Emacs

I've decided to give Doom Emacs another try, currently I'm just setting everything up again after a fresh install & I'm planning to probably look at some
YouTube tutorials to really learn Emacs from the ground up. I really like the idea of it but the last time I tried it I just got frustrated trying to get used to it.

### Movies

I'm trying to not rely on streaming services so I'm currently working on building my personal offline movie collection of all the movies on my watchlist and the ones that I have already seen & rated. 

Right now I'm in the process of trying to nicely name and organize around 370 movies and a bunch of tv shows - I'm using [filebot](https://www.filebot.net/) to automate this as much as I can.

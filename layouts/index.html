    Welcome!

<p>
    This is my personal website. It is currently <b>under construction</b>, so I am not entirely sure
    what exactly I will end up using it for. For now, it's meant to just be a small personal online
    space that I can mess around with.
    <br>
    <br>
    Some ideas & use cases that I have for this site are using it as a way for me to show off some side
    projects that I have worked on, a personal blog, a digital cv and just in general a way to share
    things that are relevant to my interests & hobbies :)
</p>
